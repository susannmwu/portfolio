# Susan's Technical Portfolio

As a software engineer with a passion for technology, I am looking for their next role in the tech industry. Recognizing the importance of showcasing my expertise and experience, I recently dedicated some time to build a portfolio that highlights my best work and projects. This break from the job search allowed me to demonstrate my technical skills but also relfect my dedication and commitment to continous learning and growth in the ever-evolving field of software engineering. I used the HTML5-Up's Miniport template as the base of my website, and made changes based on my vision and functionality needs.

## Modifications made to the base template

- Added tech stack icons in Skills section
- Added links to projects in Github, represented by Github icon
- Removed contact form section
- Added link to resume download or print PDF of my resume
- Added links to email, LinkedIn, Github, represented by icons
- Improved UX of site by adding target attribute to links
